A _code point_ (also known as _“character code”_) is a numerical representation of a specific Unicode character.

For example, the character code of the copyright symbol `©` is `169`, which can be written as `0xA9` in hex.

in js the function `String.toCharCode(n)`
returns character code or code point of that 
of the numeric unicode code point
