<h2><u>Basics of google dorking</h2></u>
in order to use google like a hacker
we need to use google search 
operators. 

`site:www.example.com <words>`
narrows your search with one specific 
site in this case example.com
no other website other then example.com
comes up

`- word`
this exclude the occurrence of `word` in search result.

`inurl:admin site:example.com`
returns url with admin keyword

`intext:name`
searches in the body of webpage weather 
they have the keyword `name` in it.

`intitle:login`
search by the website title if there is 
login keyword in it.

`filetype:pdf`
will fetch everyfile type of pdf from
website for example

`site:six-group.com filetype:pdf`
will fetch everyfile type of pdf in
six-group.com website.

or better `filetype:log`

`ext:xlsx`
