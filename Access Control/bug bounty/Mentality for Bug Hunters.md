1. <b>Don't feel intimidated because of client reputation.</b>
It doesn't matter what is the reputation 
of client either it's tiktok, tesla or oracle
just try hacking.

2. <b>Every App have vulnerability.</b>

It doesn't matter weather a software is open source,
closed sourced, been online for a decade,
been tested on a decade, is owned by big cooperations no matter what they will always have vulnerability.
