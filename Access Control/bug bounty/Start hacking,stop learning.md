<h2>Stop learning and start hacking</h2>

spending too much time learning so much
just makes you good at learning.
There are people who are very good 
at CTF but have hard time finding bugs.

learning is very important to get 
started with hacking but to keep 
learning is a bad idea.


just get used to getting your burp set up

<h2>keep it simple:</h2>

your first is going to be:
XSS, IDOR, Business logic, info disclosure.
simple payloads.

<h2>Just hack something</h2>

it doesn't matter what it is just
hack something find an idor
go out there and explore the unknown.
