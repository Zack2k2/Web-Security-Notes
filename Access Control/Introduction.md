<h2>Access control vulnerabilities</h2>

Access control vuln means that some one or some thing
(opject, server, service) 
who should not have the authentication to access 
some resources or data, have access to it.

in other words when some action is not supposed to be allowed just is allowed this type of 
vulnerability is present in every web application.

<ol>
<li><b>Authentication:</b>
	it identifies and confirm the user.
</li>
<li><b>Session Management:</b>
	identifies the set of HTTP messages that goes back
	and forth
</li>
<li><b>Access control:</b>
	determines which user gets to carry out 
	what operations.
</li>
</ol>

Broken access control is a very common problem
and is present in every complex application
due to the fact that its a dynamic problem
that applies business, organizational and 
legal constrains to a technical implementation.
Access control design mistakes are made by 
humans not technology. and potential for error 
is high.
